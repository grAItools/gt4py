# Research notes: vertical scan redesign

- **Status**: companion document to
  [scan-redesign-proposal.md](scan-redesign-proposal.md)
- **Created**: 2026-06-11

This document records the research behind the proposal: an analysis of the
current implementation (§A), a survey of prior art with sources (§B), and a
case study of vertical scan + sub-reduce algorithms (§C). §D condenses
everything into the design drivers used in the proposal.

## A. The current scan in `gt4py.next`

### A.1 User-facing API and frontend representation

`scan_operator` (`src/gt4py/next/ffront/decorator.py`, ~lines 814–864) takes
`axis`, `forward`, `init` at decoration time and builds a
`foast.ScanOperator` node (`ffront/field_operator_ast.py`, ~lines 239–247)
holding `axis`, `forward`, `init` as constants plus the scalar definition
function. There is no dedicated ITIR node: FOAST lowering
(`ffront/foast_to_gtir.py`, ~lines 121–148) produces
`as_fieldop(scan(definition, forward, init))(*args)` around the `scan`
builtin (`iterator/builtins.py`). The type is
`ts_ffront.ScanOperatorType(axis, definition)`
(`ffront/type_specifications.py`).

### A.2 Scalar↔field promotion

Because the definition is scalar but call sites pass fields,
`ffront/type_info.py` carries dedicated machinery
(`_scan_param_promotion`, ~lines 166–213; carry special-casing in argument
canonicalization, ~lines 115–128) that promotes scalar parameter types to
field types with dims harvested from the actual arguments, and demotes on
return. This is the "weird promotion/demotion" cited in the problem
statement: the declared types of the scan pass are systematically not the
types it is called with.

### A.3 Embedded execution paths

There are two:

1. **Field-view embedded** (`embedded/operators.py::ScanOperator.__call__`,
   lines 34–88): computes `domain_intersection` of the args, takes the scan
   range from the `closure_column_range` context variable (set in
   `field_operator_call` from the **out** field's domain, lines 97–133),
   then runs

   ```python
   for hpos in iterate_domain(non_scan_domain):  # every horizontal point
       for k in scan_range:  # every level
           acc = self.fun(acc, *scalar_args_at(hpos, k))
   ```

   i.e. O(n_horizontal · n_k) Python interpreter iterations with per-element
   tuple packing/unpacking — the documented embedded-performance pain.
   Notably line 58–60: if the scan axis is not in the inputs at all, it is
   *added* from the context range ("even if the scan dimension is not in the
   input, we can scan over it") — the pure-recurrence case that makes
   input-based deduction non-trivial.

2. **Iterator embedded** (`iterator/embedded.py`, `scan` builtin at ~lines
   1625–1640, used by the `roundtrip` backend): same loop structure at the
   iterator level, column range from
   `embedded_context.get_closure_column_range()`, populated by
   `_extract_column_range` (~lines 1717–1728) which patches a placeholder
   `NamedRange` whose dim is the column axis with start/stop from the
   output domain.

In both paths the **scan range is back-derived from the output domain via a
context variable** — the design wart the proposal's §3.2 removes.

### A.4 Compiled backends

- **GTFN** (`program_processors/codegens/gtfn/codegen.py`): dedicated
  `Scan`/`ScanExecution`/`ScanPassDefinition` nodes rendered into
  `vertical_executor(axis)().arg(...).scans.execute()` — a per-column
  sequential k-loop in the GridTools C++ execution model, with scan fusion at
  the stencil level.
- **DaCe**
  (`program_processors/runners/dace/lowering/gtir_to_sdfg_scan.py`): no
  native scan in DaCe; the scan dimension becomes a nested SDFG with a
  sequential loop region, horizontal dimensions become parallel Maps, scan
  arguments are passed as full columns by value.
- Domain inference (`iterator/transforms/infer_domain.py`, ~lines 487–506)
  special-cases scans to retain vertical dimensions when propagating domains.

Both compiled backends already implement exactly the execution model the
proposal keeps (sequential k per column, parallel horizontal), so the rewrite
is frontend/IR-heavy, not backend-heavy.

### A.5 Boundary-condition evidence

`tests/next_tests/integration_tests/multi_feature_tests/ffront_tests/test_icon_like_scan.py`
(an ICON `solve_nonhydro` stencil-52 extract) is the canonical specimen, and
exhibits three pain points at once:

- a `first_level: bool` flag inside the carry `NamedTuple`, branched on at
  *every* level;
- a **dummy bool output field** materialized over the full 3D domain, only
  because carry == output forces the flag to be emitted (one test variant
  even exists specifically because backends needed the unused output
  written);
- program-level slicing `out=(z_q[:, 1:], w[:, 1:], dummy[:, 1:])` to place
  the result, coupling the scan to its caller's indexing.

ADR 0022 (`docs/development/ADRs/next/0022-Limitations-of-embedded-concat_where.md`)
documents the `concat_where` domain-expression API (`KDim == 0`, `KDim > 0`,
contiguous 1D regions only) — the existing vocabulary the proposal reuses for
peelable in-body conditionals and outside-the-scan composition.

### A.6 `gt4py.cartesian` for contrast

GTScript (`src/gt4py/cartesian/gtscript.py`) provides
`with computation(FORWARD|BACKWARD|PARALLEL)` and `with interval(a, b)`:
non-overlapping vertical regions each with their own statements, and offset
reads of already-updated fields (`field[0,0,-1]` in FORWARD) for
recurrences. Boundary conditions are separate interval blocks — no flags, no
runtime branches — and backends (GridTools) implement them as split k-loops
with k-caches. This is the proven UX target for boundary handling; what it
lacks is the explicit carry/init story and any array-ecosystem interop.

### A.7 Production evidence: icon4py muphys and microphysics

Survey of `C2SM/icon4py` at commit `515763c` (2026-06-12),
https://github.com/C2SM/icon4py — the largest production users of
`scan_operator`. GitHub code search finds 8 `scan_operator` uses repo-wide;
the two microphysics packages dominate.

**muphys** (`model/atmosphere/subgrid_scale_physics/muphys/`, port of the
one-moment "muphys" scheme): exactly one scan, `_precip_and_t` in
`implementations/graupel.py`, and it is the canonical *fused* scan:

- **Carry**: nested NamedTuples (`IntegrationState` containing four
  `PrecipStateQx(x, p, vc, activated)` — rain/snow/ice/graupel — plus
  `TempState(t, eflx, activated)`, `rho`, `pflx_tot`), i.e. **21 scalar
  components**. Body signature: carry + 10 arguments (one a 6-component `Q`
  NamedTuple) = 15 scalar inputs, four of them precomputed per-level boolean
  mask fields (`kmin_r = q.r > qmin` etc., built outside as `CellKField[bool]`).
- **Five recurrences in one scan**: the four species sedimentation
  recurrences are mutually independent (each reads only its own carry slot
  plus shared `rho`/`zeta`); they are instantiated from a helper
  `precip_qx_level_update(previous_level_q, previous_level_rho, prefactor, exponent, offset, …)` called four times with per-species constants — a
  hand-made abstraction for "one species' scan body". The fifth recurrence
  (temperature/energy flux) couples to the others only through *same-level*
  outputs (`pr=r_update.p`, `pflx_tot=s_update.p + i_update.p + g_update.p`).
  Nothing about the physics requires one scan; the construct does.
- **Carry as workaround channel**: of 21 components, `t_state.t` and
  `pflx_tot` are never read from `previous_level` — pure output channels
  (carry == output). `rho` is carried solely as a **delay line**: the flux
  average needs ρ at k−1 and a scan body cannot read an input at an offset.
  The symmetric problem — lookahead — is solved *outside* the scan:
  `t_kp1 = concat_where(dims.KDim < last_lev, t(Koff[1]), t)` precomputed
  and passed as an extra input.
- **Scalar-body tax**: `core/properties.py` / `core/thermo.py` maintain
  duplicated `*_scalar` twins of field operators (`_fall_speed_scalar`,
  docstring "Compute the scalar fall speed (can be used in scan operator)";
  `_T_from_internal_energy_scalar`, "scalar version callable from
  scan_operator") — and the scan body *still* manually inlines one "in order
  to avoid scan_operator -> field_operator" (graupel.py:155).
- **Work-skipping branch**: the body wraps everything in
  `if current_level_activated:` with an identity else-branch, annotated
  `# TODO(): … Can be made unnecessary with future transformations.`
  (graupel.py:217). The identity branch generates per-level self-copies that
  ~650 lines of hand-written DaCe hooks
  (`implementations/graupel_dace_hooks.py`: `remove_self_copy_inside_scan`,
  `rename_intermediate_access_nodes`) exist to repair, plus in/out buffer
  aliasing flagged "not best GT4Py practice".
- **Surface outputs by program slicing**: `pr, ps, pi, pg, pre` are written
  with `dims.KDim: (vertical_end - 1, vertical_end)` domains in the
  `@gtx.program` and allocated as single-level fields — i.e. the *final
  carry*, extracted manually.
- **Tracing scale**: drivers wrap execution in a `recursion_limit(10**4)` /
  `(10**5)` context manager, "TODO(havogt): make an option in gt4py?".

**Old microphysics** (`microphysics/stencils/graupel_stencils.py`,
`_icon_graupel_scan`): the same pattern without the NamedTuple hygiene — a
**flat 28-tuple carry** preceded by `sys.setrecursionlimit(350000)`
("The limit has to be manually set to a huge value for a big scan
operator"). Carry slots include five `*_kup` caches of previous-level
*derived* values (`rho_kup`, `qvsw_kup`, …— delay lines again), four fall
speeds, an explicit level counter (`k_lev = k_lev + 1`) used for
`is_surface = True if k_lev == ground_level else False` branching at four
places, and `cloud top distance`. The wrapper field operator unpacks all 28
outputs and **discards 13 of them with `_`**. Ground fluxes are computed by
two separate post-scan field operators over sliced domains
(`(ground_level, num_levels)` / `(model_top, ground_level)`) consuming the
scan's by-product outputs.

**Other icon4py scans** (completing the survey): `diagnose_pressure.py` —
backward scan, carry `(pressure, pressure_interface, is_first_level: bool)`
with the bool as first-iteration flag and one slot never read back;
`metric_fields.py::_compute_param` — carry `(gtx.int32, bool)` maintaining a
hand-rolled k counter purely to compare against level bounds;
`solve_tridiagonal_matrix_for_w_{forward_sweep,back_substitution}.py` —
clean, natural Thomas-algorithm scans (carry `(c', d')` / scalar), the
motivating case for a `tridiagonal_solve` primitive (§B.7).

Implications fed back into the proposal: P6, goals 6–7, K-local views
(§3.1), final-carry surface outputs, and the scan-fusion obligation (§3.8).

## B. Prior art

### B.1 JAX

**`jax.lax.scan(f, init, xs=None, length=None, reverse=False, unroll=1)`**
with `f :: (c, a) -> (c, b)`, scanning the leading axis of the `xs` pytree,
returning `(final_carry, stacked_ys)`. Reference semantics from the docs:

```python
def scan(f, init, xs):
    carry = init
    ys = []
    for x in xs:
        carry, y = f(carry, x)
        ys.append(y)
    return carry, np.stack(ys)
```

Salient properties for our design:

- carry must keep fixed structure/shape/dtype across iterations (init defines
  it);
- carry and stacked output are **separate** concepts;
- `xs=None` + `length=` gives pure recurrences — note this forces an explicit
  length, mirroring our "pure recurrences must state a range" rule;
- `reverse=True` keeps `ys` index-aligned with `xs` (our `forward=False`);
- static trip count and shapes; no early exit (that is `lax.while_loop`,
  which loses reverse-mode AD and output stacking);
- `f` operates on array *slices*, so batching over columns is `vmap` — the
  canonical NWP-shaped pattern is "vmap over columns, scan over k", and under
  `vmap` the carry simply becomes a per-column array. No scalar↔field
  promotion problem exists by construction.

**`jax.lax.associative_scan(fn, elems, reverse=False, axis=0)`**: parallel
prefix (Blelloch-style, O(n) work / O(log n) depth) for *associative* `fn`;
linear recurrences `x[k] = a[k]·x[k-1] + b[k]` are associative over `(a, b)`
pairs, so vertical integrals and even the Thomas forward sweep (2×2
matrix/Möbius form, with stability caveats) can be cast into it.

### B.2 Array API standard / NumPy

- `cumulative_sum(x, *, axis, dtype, include_initial=False)` entered the
  standard in 2023.12 (RFC data-apis/array-api#597); `include_initial=True`
  prepends the identity, yielding length N+1 — the exclusive/inclusive scan
  with explicit initial value, exactly the staggered-grid (interface vs
  cell-center) shape. `cumulative_prod` followed in 2024.12 (RFC #598).
- **No general scan** (reduce-with-carry) exists in the standard and no open
  proposal was found; the standard avoids higher-order functions because
  function-valued arguments sit poorly with lazy/graph array libraries.
  Consequence: portable embedded lowering exists only for `cumsum`/`cumprod`;
  a general scan must remain a GT4Py-level construct.
- NumPy's `np.ufunc.accumulate` generalizes only over binary ufuncs; custom
  Python ufuncs run at interpreter speed.
- **Inclusive/exclusive duality.** With `y[k] = f(y[k-1], x[k])`: the
  *inclusive* scan emits the carry after consuming `x[k]`; the *exclusive*
  scan emits the carry before (so `y[k0] = init`, and
  `exclusive[k] = inclusive[k-1]`); `include_initial=True` is "inclusive
  plus the init emitted one level upstream", subsuming both
  (exclusive = include_initial minus the last level). For NWP this duality
  *is* the cell-center/interface staggering: n cell increments integrate to
  n+1 interface values whose first entry is the boundary condition. It also
  reframes the "boundary condition at the first level" idiom: `y[0] = bc; y[k] = f(y[k-1], x[k])` is precisely an inclusive scan over `[1, n)` with
  its init emitted at 0 — one primitive, no special case (proposal §3.3).

### B.3 PyTorch

`torch._higher_order_ops.scan.scan(combine_fn, init, xs, *, dim=0, reverse=False) -> (carry, ys)` — a JAX-shaped general scan, pytree support,
fixed carry structure, **prototype** (requires `torch.compile`, documented
miscompile risk). `torch.associative_scan(combine_fn, xs, dim, reverse, combine_mode)` — prototype, CUDA-codegen-only efficient path, no autograd,
open correctness issues (e.g. pytorch/pytorch#137943). PyTorch/XLA ships its
own JAX-shaped `scan`/`scan_layers`.

Two lessons: (1) the whole Python array ecosystem converged on the
`(carry, x) -> (carry, y)` signature; (2) compiling a *general* scan is hard
(prototype after 2+ years) while fixed-op cumulatives are trivial — support
for keeping the general primitive semantically simple and sequential.

### B.4 Futhark

`scan (f: t -> t -> t) (neutral: t) (arr: []t)` requires `f` associative
with a neutral element — that requirement is what licenses parallel-prefix
codegen. Non-associative recurrences use the explicitly sequential
`loop pat = init for i < n do body` construct. Futhark thus encodes the
**two-tier design** — restricted-but-parallelizable `scan` vs general
sequential `loop` — in the language itself. (Futhark also published
reverse-mode AD of scan, relevant if differentiable vertical solvers become a
requirement.)

### B.5 Halide

Reductions/recurrences are *update definitions* over an `RDom`: e.g.
`f(x) = f(x-1) + in(x)` traversed serially in order, with pure dimensions
schedulable in parallel around it — the exact "parallel columns, serial k"
factorization, expressed as a *scheduling* property. Two transferable ideas:

- **`rfactor`** (Suriana, Adams & Kamil, CGO'17): the scheduler may split a
  serial reduction into parallel partial reductions when it can synthesize an
  associative operator — associativity as a scheduling concern, invisible in
  the algorithm definition.
- **Boundary conditions** (`BoundaryConditions::repeat_edge`,
  `constant_exterior`, …) are wrappers that make out-of-range reads
  well-defined, and Halide's **loop partitioning** specializes the
  steady-state interior so border handling costs nothing in the inner loop —
  the formal version of the "peeling guarantee" in the proposal.

### B.6 Weather & climate DSLs

- **GTScript / gt4py.cartesian**: `computation(FORWARD|BACKWARD)` +
  `interval(...)` vertical regions + offset reads of already-updated values;
  see §A.6. Docs: https://gridtools.github.io/gt4py/latest/gtscript.html
- **GridTools C++**: same vertical execution model plus **k-caches** — ring
  buffers in registers/shared memory for vertical loop-carried dependencies,
  with `fill`/`flush` IO policies; the user-manual worked example is a
  tridiagonal solver (FORWARD elimination interval + BACKWARD substitution).
  https://gridtools.github.io/gridtools/latest/user_manual/user_manual.html
- **STELLA** (COSMO GPU dycore predecessor) pioneered the model; vertical
  advection/tridiagonal solve is a canonical benchmark.
  https://github.com/GridTools/stencil_benchmarks
- **Dawn/GTClang**: `vertical_region(k_start, k_end)` as the SIR construct;
  the compiler does interval splitting/merging, k-cache assignment, fusion.
  https://github.com/MeteoSwiss-APN/dawn ,
  https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/Publications/.pdf/osuna-dawn.pdf
- **PSyclone / LFRic**: kernels with `operates_on = CELL_COLUMN` — users
  write plain k-loops over a whole column, PSyclone generates horizontal
  parallelism ("vmap over columns" by codegen). Additionally **CMA
  (Column-wise Matrix Assembly) operators**: columnwise banded
  assemble/apply/inverse-apply as first-class kernel types — vertical solvers
  as built-in operator objects rather than user scans.
  https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dynamo0p3.html ,
  https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qj.3880
- **ICON GPU port**: OpenACC over Fortran; vertical recurrences are serial
  k-loops inside `!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP` over columns. No scan abstraction;
  production evidence that sequential-k/parallel-columns is the right GPU
  execution model.

### B.7 Tridiagonal solvers as primitives

- `jax.lax.linalg.tridiagonal_solve(dl, d, du, b)` — batched; lowers to
  cuSPARSE `gtsv2` on GPU, Thomas/LAPACK on CPU; JVP rule exists; batching
  currently loops rather than using `gtsv2StridedBatch` (perf issue
  jax-ml/jax#28544).
- cuSPARSE `gtsv2` / `gtsv2StridedBatch` / `gtsv2_nopivot`: vendor batched
  solvers (cyclic-reduction/PCR based).
- GPU literature: Kim et al., *A Scalable Tridiagonal Solver for GPUs*
  (hybrid Thomas+PCR); Merrill/Garland-era CR/PCR analyses; PaScaL_TDMA for
  multi-GPU. For NWP shapes (k≈100, huge batch) a thread-per-column Thomas
  sweep is usually optimal — the primitive's value is **ergonomics and pinned
  numerics**, not raw speed.
- Most stencil DSLs do *not* offer it built in (users hand-write two sweeps);
  LFRic CMA and JAX are the exceptions and the model to follow.

### B.8 Windowed scans and higher-order recurrences

- Any order-m recurrence reduces to a first-order scan with an m-tuple carry
  (standard JAX idiom; Blelloch, *Scans and Linear Recurrences*,
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/alg/scan.html). Higher-order *linear*
  recurrences remain parallelizable: Maleki & Burtscher, PLDI'16
  (https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/papers/pldi16.pdf) and
  ASPLOS'18 (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3296957.3173168).
- GTScript/Halide instead expose **offset reads of the in-progress output**
  (`f[0,0,-1]`, `f(x-2)`) with k-caches/registers making the window fast —
  the ergonomic alternative surface syntax; the compiler infers the
  equivalent carry depth.
- **Local-view precedent inside gt4py itself**: at the ITIR level the scan
  pass already receives *iterators*, not values — they can be shifted and
  dereferenced (see the scan in
  `tests/next_tests/unit_tests/iterator_tests/transforms_tests/test_domain_inference.py`,
  whose pass is `λ(init, it). deref(shift("Ioff", 1)(it))`). Only the ffront
  `scan_operator` flattens arguments to scalars. A K-local-view body
  (proposal §3.1) therefore maps onto the *existing* IR; GridTools fill-type
  k-caches (§B.6) are the corresponding execution mechanism. This also
  resolves the asymmetry that read-only inputs admit *lookahead* (`x[+1]` in
  a forward scan — used by muphys via external precomputation, §A.7) which
  no carry encoding can express.
- Merrill & Garland, *Single-pass Parallel Prefix Scan with Decoupled
  Look-back* (NVIDIA NVR-2016-002,
  https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2016-03_Single-pass-Parallel-Prefix/nvr-2016-002.pdf)
  is the CUB `DeviceScan` building block if a backend ever parallelizes in k.

### B.9 Boundary-condition-friendly constructs (survey)

| Mechanism                                 | Where                                                    | Character                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vertical regions / interval dispatch      | GTScript `interval`, Dawn `vertical_region`              | declarative, compiler splits k-loop, zero steady-state cost      |
| Explicit init carry                       | JAX/Futhark; array-API `include_initial`                 | BC = initial state, evaluated once, no branch                    |
| Step-index predication                    | JAX (`where`/`cond` on an index in `xs`), manual peeling | works, but is exactly the clumsy pattern; no first-class support |
| Out-of-range wrappers + loop partitioning | Halide `BoundaryConditions::*`                           | reads beyond bounds defined; interior specialized                |

The synthesis adopted by the proposal: explicit init (row 2) for state
seeding **plus** peel-guaranteed index conditionals (rows 1+4 combined) for
differing first/last-level computations.

## C. Case study: scan + sub-reduce in the vertical

### C.1 The COSMO/ICON two-moment sedimentation scheme

Source: U. Blahak, *New implementation of explicit hydrometeor sedimentation
in the Seifert-Beheng 2-moment bulk microphysical scheme*, DWD, 2020-02-24,
http://www.cosmo-model.org/content/model/documentation/core/docu_sedi_twomom.pdf

Setting: bulk sedimentation `∂(ρq)/∂t = −∂/∂z [v(ρq)·ρq]`, explicit
first-order scheme, fluxes `P` on half levels, k increasing top→bottom:

```
ϕ_k(i+1) = ϕ_k(i) − (P_{k−1/2} − P_{k+1/2})·Δt / Δz_k        (eq. 3)
```

The time integral of the flux through a face is rewritten (via a δ-function
argument) as a *height integral over the levels above*, masked to the
fall-distance reach (eqs. 6–7):

```
P(z_f)·Δt ≈ −∫_{z_f}^{∞} ϕ(z)·F(z) dz ,   F = 1 if 0 < z − z_f < |v(z)|Δt else 0
```

Two discretizations:

- **Current scheme** (eq. 9–11, `-DSEDI_VECTORIZED`): approximate `v(z)` by
  the face value `v_{k+1/2}` everywhere above, giving a *boxcar* mask and a
  running-Courant recurrence `c_{k−l} = (c_{k−l+1} − 1)·Δz_{k−l+1}/Δz_{k−l}`
  with summation `P_{k+1/2}Δt ≈ −Σ_l ϕ_{k−l}·min[c_{k−l}, 1]·Δz_{k−l}`,
  stopped when `c < 1`. Vectorizes (NEC), but produces unphysical
  "rain congestion" pulses at Courant > 1.

- **New scheme** ("boxtracking", eq. 12): no approximation of `v(z)`;
  per-level **gather over the levels above**:

  ```
  P_{k+1/2}·Δt ≈ −Σ_{l=0}^{k−1} ϕ_{k−l} · (z_up − z_low)
  z_up  = min[ z_{k+1/2−l−1} , z_{k+1/2} + |v_{k−l}|Δt ]
  z_low = min[ z_{k+1/2−l}   , z_up ]
  ```

  Note the **self-masking**: when level k−l is out of reach,
  `z_up = z_{k+1/2} + |v_{k−l}|Δt = z_low` and the contribution is exactly 0.
  The paper's reference implementation is the work-efficient **scatter**
  form: an outer loop over source levels k with an inner
  `while Δsum < |v_k|Δt` loop scattering `−ϕ_k·(z_up − z_low)` into the
  fluxes of the faces below. The paper notes this form "does not properly
  vectorize" on NEC — i.e. the work-efficient form is the
  vectorization-hostile one, the gather form is the vectorizable one.

### C.2 The gist: six formulations and the key transformation

https://gist.github.com/havogt/c52d19f2f7557c2c048d12be7330bda8
(`test_sedim_box_standalone.py`) implements the box scheme six ways; the
interesting axis of variation:

| Variant                 | Form                                                               | Complexity            | Notes                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `box_sedim_paper`       | scatter + data-dependent `while`                                   | O(n·M̄) work-efficient | the paper's algorithm; serial, scatter writes                                           |
| `box_sedim_naive`       | gather, full triangle `for m in range(k+1)`                        | O(n²)                 | direct eq. 12                                                                           |
| `box_sedim_naive_break` | gather + monotonicity `break`                                      | O(n·M̄)                | early exit ⇒ not vectorizable                                                           |
| `box_sedim_naive_func`  | gather written as `Σ_m f(shift_origin(·, k), m)`                   | O(n²)/O(n·M)          | **the windowed-stencil formulation** — per-output sum of a function of K-shifted inputs |
| `box_sedim_scanlike`    | forward k-loop + **rolling buffers** (`z`: 4, `v`: 3, `phi`: 3)    | O(n·M), M=3 fixed     | bounded window ⇒ single pass, O(M) state                                                |
| `box_sedim_scan`        | same, packaged as `scan(scanpass, range, init=(None, buffers...))` | O(n·M)                | shows the carry: ring buffers + level index `k` passed in                               |

The load-bearing observations:

1. **If the window is bounded** (max Courant number ⇒ contributions reach at
   most M levels), the algorithm needs only the last M levels of `z`, `v`,
   `phi` at each k. `box_sedim_scanlike` carries them in ring buffers — i.e.
   the scan + sub-reduce *is* an ordinary first-order scan with an O(M) carry.
2. But in this particular scheme the contributions don't depend on any
   *running* state at all (no P feedback, the apparent recurrence is only the
   cumulative height, which is itself a `cumsum` of `Δz` and here a plain
   input `z`). So the bounded form is **not even a scan** — it is a vertical
   stencil with a static window and a sum-reduction:
   `P[k] = −Σ_{m=0..M} ϕ[k−m]·(z_up(k,m) − z_low(k,m))`. The ring buffers in
   the gist are a *memory-locality optimization* (k-caches), not a semantic
   necessity — exactly the thing a compiler, not the user, should introduce.
3. The level-index conditionals in `box_sedim_scanlike` (`if k <= 1`,
   `elif k == 2`) are pure *array-boundary masking* of the window (don't read
   above the model top) — skip-value semantics, not physics.
4. The data-dependent extent (`while`/`break` variants) buys work-efficiency
   at the cost of vectorization — the same trade the paper documents on NEC.
   The GPU/SIMD-friendly version is the masked fixed bound, relying on
   self-masking (observation in §C.1) for correctness.

### C.3 Pattern classification

Generalizing, "scan + sub-reduce in the vertical" decomposes into:

```
out[k] = reduce_{m ∈ W(k)} g( x[k], x[k−m], x[k−m±1], …, s[k] )
s[k]   = scan-state (optional), e.g. cumulative height, running mass
```

with three regimes:

1. **Static bounded window, no state feedback** (sedimentation gather with
   CFL bound; PPM flux integration with bounded departure range): a windowed
   stencil + reduction. Needs: K-window access, masking at array boundaries,
   a reduction over the window. *No scan construct required*; any cumulative
   quantities (heights from Δz) are separate `cumsum`s composed in front.
2. **Bounded window + genuine recurrence** (the window contribution feeds or
   reads running state; higher-order recurrences): a scan whose carry
   includes a ring buffer of the last M slices, and/or window access to
   inputs inside the body. The gist's `box_sedim_scan` shows the manual
   encoding; the toolchain should derive it from "window access inside a
   scan body".
3. **Data-dependent extent / scatter** (the paper's work-efficient form;
   unbounded Courant numbers): inner `while` over a data-dependent range, or
   scatter-writes to multiple output levels per step. Hostile to
   vectorization, vmap, AD, and parallel-in-k; production vector codes
   already avoid it. Covered by regime 1/2 plus a static bound `M = ⌈max CFL⌉` and masking; genuinely unbounded cases fall back to multiple passes
   or host-side chunking.

### C.4 Cost analysis of the masked-bounded form

Work: O(n_k · M) vs O(n_k · M̄) for the data-dependent form (M̄ = mean
extent ≤ M). For sedimentation M is small (the gist uses 3; max CFL in the
paper's experiments ~10 only in the degenerate thin-layer near-ground case);
the overhead factor M/M̄ is bounded and is paid in exchange for full
column-vectorization — the same trade GPU tridiagonal/PCR literature and the
NEC-vectorized COSMO variant make. Memory: regime-1 windowed stencils read
each input O(M) times without caching; ring-buffer/k-cache lowering restores
O(1) reads per element — GridTools k-caches (§B.6) are precisely this and
already exist in the GTFN execution substrate.

### C.5 Other instances of the pattern

- **PPM / semi-Lagrangian flux-form advection** (Colella & Woodward 1984;
  Lin & Rood 1996; FV3's vertical remapping): piecewise-parabolic
  reconstruction is a small-window vertical stencil; the flux through a face
  integrates the reconstruction over the departure region, which spans a
  data-dependent but CFL-bounded number of cells — regime 1 with a `cumsum`
  (cumulative mass/height) composed in front. The integer-offset "how many
  whole cells does the trajectory cross" logic becomes a window-masked sum.
- **ICON two-moment microphysics sedimentation**
  (`mo_2mom_mcrph_processes.f90`, `lboxtracking` variants): the production
  Fortran of §C.1, applied simultaneously to mass and number densities
  (tuple-valued `ϕ`) with moment-coupled fall speeds — same structure, tuple
  element types.
- **Precipitation-flux style schemes generally** (implicit/explicit
  column microphysics with flux limiting): forward scan for the flux with
  carry = flux entering the cell, occasionally needing the previous M levels
  of hydrometeor state — regime 2.

### C.6 Mapping to the proposed constructs

| Regime              | Construct (proposal §)                                | Embedded lowering                                                                               | Compiled lowering                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1: windowed stencil | `WindowOffset` + `neighbor_sum` + skip-masking (§3.4) | stacked shifted views / `sliding_window_view`; JAX: slices, fully `jit`/`vmap`-able             | unrolled window in the k-loop; k-caches for reuse |
| 2: windowed scan    | window access inside `@gtx.scan` body (§3.1+§3.4)     | per-level slice expressions; JAX: `lax.scan` with ring-buffer carry synthesized by the frontend | fill-type k-caches in the scan loop               |
| 3: data-dependent   | static bound + masking (§4.8); not supported natively | —                                                                                               | —                                                 |

The sedimentation example in proposal §3.4 demonstrates regime 1 end-to-end:
the proposal's `box_sedim_flux` is a line-by-line vectorization of the
gist's `box_sedim_naive_func` with the window machinery absorbing
`shift_origin`, the triangle bound, and the boundary `if`s.
